# Hippogriff
Hippogriff is a wrapper and prep script for debian systems to prepare them for OSINT and some light vulnerability scanning

It was thrown together as a proof of concept to show that you don't need Kali Linux for everything, but that building a toolkit for yourself is the better way to work.


The hoppe for this project is for it to grow into a full toolchain with a GUI to enable ease of use for new people to the cybersecurity landscape.
